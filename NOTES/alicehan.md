## GitHub Review 
- in order to collaborate on a repo without overwhelming with too many changes, you can fork the repo and create a pull request (what we are doing now)
- trying to contribute ot main repository (think of them as other branches):
  1. fork the repository and then clone it 
  2. add remotes -- origin points to your repository; upstream points to the repository you are trying to conribute to
  3. then work in your repo, add, commit --> makes a PR to the priginal repo to request that your changes can be reviewed and approved
