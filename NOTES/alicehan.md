## GitHub Review 
- in order to collaborate on a repo without overwhelming with too many changes, you can fork the repo and create a pull request (what we are doing now)
- trying to contribute ot main repository (think of them as other branches):
  1. fork the repository and then clone it 
  2. add remotes -- origin points to your repository; upstream points to the repository you are trying to conribute to
  3. then work in your repo, add, commit --> makes a PR to the priginal repo to request that your changes can be reviewed and approved
- main branch should be stable - not where you should be doing development
## Linear Algebra
- hard to tell what exact factors contribute to a given result 
- need to know under which circumstances a hypothesis is made false (what data points makes it wrong)
- y = f(x) gives us an idea of how the data trends, but there will still be variation 
- confirmation bias -- just because you feel like you see relationship, doesn't necessarily mean that it is there(?)
- working with a finite set of points and asked to find this relationship
- positive example supports hypothesis; negative doesn't
